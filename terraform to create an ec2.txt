How to use terraform to create an ec2 instance

prerequiste 
install terraform with powershell or download
install AWS CLI( you can check "AWS-CLI.txt" on this repo for step by step procedure to install AWS CLI )
install any text editor eg "VS code or sublime"
install git bash or use powershell admin as terminal

STEP 1
create a folder on your desktop
Create a file "fllename.tf" make sure you save the file with ".tf" as it extension  inside the folder
copy this code to  into the filename.tf you created

Afore you copy, edit the following info to your own aws account info 

1. region
2. ami (select ec2 on your console, select launch instance, select Amazon linux 2 and copy the ami id)
3. availability zone
4. vpc_security_group_id (create or use an existing security group copy the security group id from aws console)
5. key name: create a keypair on your aws console
6. use any name for name and project

here is the code 


provider "aws" {
 region = "us-east-1"
  # access_key = ""
  # secret_key =""
}

resource "aws_instance" "trial" {
    ami                    = "ami-0cff7528ff583bf9a"
    instance_type          = "t2.micro"
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    key_name               = "terra"
    vpc_security_group_ids =["sg-07561dcec1656f146"]
    tags ={
        Name    = "terraform-ec2"
        Project = "ec2"
    }
}


end of code

STEP 2

Go to your windows powershell admin or bash terminal
navigate into the folder where you save filenmae.tf on powershell terminal or git bash
run "aws --version" to be sure aws cli is installed
run  "aws configure"
paste your access key
paste your secret key
type the region you want eg "us-east-1"
type "json" as default format

STEP 3
how to intialize terraform

run "terraform init"
note: it takes some min to intialize because it is installing some plugins
run "terraform plan"
run "terraform apply" this will make terraform to launch an ec2 instance 

to cross check, go to your aws console, a new instance should be launch.

to destroy the instance when you are done
run "terraform destroy"
